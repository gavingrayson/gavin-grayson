            <h1>3 Reasons why to not drink and drive</h1>
            <i><p>"one day the my wife decided do drive home while drunk after a girls night out<br/>
            She never made it home because she died driving off of a cliff. i wish i could have told her i love her<br</p>
        it saddens me until this day. I hope to spread awareness about drinking a driving."</i>
            <p>The last quote came from a friend who was strongly affected by drinking and driving <br/>
                this quote hit home because it have a wife and this could probably happen to her. spreading awareness <br/>
                would slow down drinking and driving rates for good.
                <p>
                    Here is another quote from another buddy of mine. "one day i was at a party that lasted all through the night.<br/>
                    I was heavily drinking not knowing i would have to drive myself home that night because I wanted to show out.<br/>
                    My friends dared me to drive my sisters car off a bridge and i did it. i am just glad to have survived."
