            <h3>Gavin was born in Milwaukee wisconsin june 11 2001. Before the age of three his cousin was<br>
            struck by an ice cream truck. This hurt him the most since he was Gavin's favorite cousin.<br>
        this drove gavin to want to make his own ice cream shop when he got older so that he could bring<br>
    absolute safety when it came to ice cream. Gavin wanted to make sure that people who wanted ice cream<br>
could attain it safely. this may be a dumb reason to start selling ice cream, but in his head it all made <br>
sense. while still in college and selling ice cream from his back door, his uncle passed. this drove him to <br>
take ice cream selling more seriously, so ge quit college and took off with what money he had left. he later<br>
ran into an old friend who had become rich. this friend ended up being Gavin's wife. she later funded his passion<br>
so that he could attain his own shop and website. he decided to stay in milwaukee and put his shop where he grew up</h3>
